# Attendance Hall of Fame Feature

## Overview
The Attendance Hall of Fame is a gamified feature that encourages clan participation by showcasing the clan with the highest attendance percentage at the latest completed weekly bash event.

## How It Works

### 📊 **Calculation Logic**
1. **Finds Latest Weekly Bash**: Gets the most recent completed event with "Weekly Bash" in the title
2. **Calculates Clan Percentages**: For each clan:
   ```
   Attendance % = (Members who attended / Total clan members) × 100
   ```
3. **Ranks Clans**: Sorts by attendance percentage (highest first)
4. **Displays Winner**: Shows the top-performing clan in the banner

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Queries**
```sql
-- Get clan members
SELECT id, clan_name, clan_id FROM members 
WHERE clan_id IS NOT NULL AND clan_name IS NOT NULL

-- Get event attendance  
SELECT member_id FROM attendance WHERE event_id = ?

-- Calculate percentages per clan
attendance_percentage = (attended_members / total_members) * 100
```

### **Route Structure**
