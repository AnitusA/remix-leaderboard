## üìû Support and Maintenance

The attendance dashboard is fully integrated with the existing application architecture and follows established patterns for authentication, data access, and user interface design. All components are properly typed with TypeScript and include comprehensive error handling.

For any issues or feature requests, the modular design allows for easy extension and modification of individual components without affecting the broader application functionality.
