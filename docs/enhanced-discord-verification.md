## Verification Process

### 1. Authentication Check
- Validates GitHub authentication
- Retrieves GitHub username from session
- Checks member database record

### 2. Discord Username Validation
- **Server Presence**: Confirms user exists in Discord server
- **Username Matching**: Checks multiple name formats:
  - `user.username` (e.g., "johndoe")
  - `user.globalName` (e.g., "John Doe")
  - `displayName` (e.g., "Johnny")
- **Role Analysis**: Identifies current Discord roles

### 3. Eligibility Assessment
- **Title Check**: Ensures user has eligible title:
  - ‚úÖ Basher, Captain Bash, Organiser, Mentor, Legacy Basher, Rookie
  - ‚ùå Null Basher (suspended users)
- **Role Requirements**: Determines if Basher role should be assigned

### 4. Role Management
- **Remove Rookie**: If user has Rookie/Visitor role, removes it
- **Assign Basher**: Adds Basher role if eligible
- **Verify Changes**: Confirms role assignment was successful
